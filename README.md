# Rubik's Cube MCP

An experiment that didn't ultimately work out.

This is an MCP server deployable on Cloudflare Workers that simulates a Rubik's Cube and let's
a connected LLM agent apply moves.

While it may be that I have not managed to give the LLM a representation that "makes sense" to it,
and while I occasionally do get some results that shows the LLM seemingly "thinking" through the problem,
the output is not really that distinct from random noise.

Perhaps I will pick this back up in the future, especially as new models come out and MCP evolves.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm i && npm start
```
